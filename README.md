# Revolut churn prediction

A project to model and forecast user churn. 

# Virtual Environments

For the creation of virtual environments (VE) anaconda is used. You can download anaconda via here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

After installing anaconda into your system follow the steps bellow to work in a virtual environment.

Creation of the VE:

```
conda create python=3.7 --name churn
conda activate churn 
```

To install all necesery packages from the **requirements.txt** file run: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio code there may be some additional pop ups indiciating that some packages should be installed (linter, ikernel and others).
